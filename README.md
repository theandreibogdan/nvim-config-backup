# nvim-config-backup
just the backup for my nvim-config

make sure you have installed:
* nvim 0.10 +
* lua
* luarocks
* npm
* cargo
* pip
* python3-venv

If on PopOs try to install nvim with snap, replace the path of the nvim command from the original one to the one from /snap/nvim -> but do the config inaisw the original ~/.config/nvim dir
